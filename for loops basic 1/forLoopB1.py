# # Basic - Print all integers from 0 to 150.

# for x in range(0,151):
#     print(x)

# # Multiples of Five - Print all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000

# for i in range(5,1001,5):
#     print(i)

# Counting, the Dojo Way - Print integers 1 to 100. If divisible by 5, print "Coding" instead. If divisible by 10, print "Coding Dojo".

# for j in range(0,101):
#     if j % 5 == 1:
#         print("coding")
#     if j % 10 == 1:
#         print("Coding Dojo")

# Whoa. That Sucker's Huge - Add odd integers from 0 to 500,000, and print the final sum.

# count = 0
# for z in range(1,500001,2):
#     count = z + count

# print(count)
# Countdown by Fours - Print positive numbers starting at 2018, counting down by fours.

# for x in range(2018, 0, -4):
#     print(x)

# Flexible Counter - Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the
# integers that are a multiple of mult. For example, if lowNum=2, highNum=9, and mult=3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines)

# lowNum = 2
# highNum = 9
# mult = 3
# for x in range(lowNum, highNum, mult):
#     print(x + 1)
